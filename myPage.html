          <h2>Hello! My name is Conor. I'm a Full-Stack web developer.</h2>
          <p>
            I started my coding education in early 2022 with the intent of unlocking professional potential in one the largest fixtures in our society, computers. Since then, I have gain fluency in Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS; with my expertise in these avenunes continuing to show marked improvement. As I start to grow comfortable with coding, I wanted to create a platform for sharing my skills, as well as a place to chart their progression. In my free time I enjoy meditating, hiking, and training mixed martial arts; I hope I can find a way to intertwine these aspects of my life with burgeoning craft.
